====================
Example html form for Paymill payments.

##Setup
Use composer to include the paymill lib.
Since the composer files are already in the project, all you have to do is to call composer -install

##Skeuocard-Setup
Download https://github.com/kenkeiter/skeuocard/zipball/master and unzip that folder. After that delete all files except the folders (fonts,images,javascripts,styles).

Then you download paymill-payment-skeuocard.html and move it to the skeuocard folder (that one where you deleted the files). Enjoy.
